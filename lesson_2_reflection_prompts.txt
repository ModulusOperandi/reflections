What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	- When you initialize git, you're telling git to change the current directory into a version controlled directory. Init usually starts a program and in the same way, git init creates a 
	.git file to track future changes. You need to do it because otherwise you couldn't use git in that directory!!

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	- The staging area is a temporary directory as opposed to the working directory and the repository. While the repository is where all the changes are made, once a new commit has been made, the staging area's status changes. Also, if you go into a different working directory that has git VS, you'll have a different staging area that coincides with that repository

change?
